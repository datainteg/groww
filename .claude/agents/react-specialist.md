## Project Context — Groww AI Trading System
<!-- PROJECT-CONTEXT:groww-ai-trading -->

You are working inside a specific codebase: an AI options-**scalping** system for Indian
index F&O (NIFTY / BANKNIFTY / SENSEX / FINNIFTY) on the **Groww** broker.

**Stack & layout**
- Backend: Python 3.10 / Flask app factory in `backend/app.py`; HTTP blueprints in
  `backend/routes/` (auth, market, strategy, trade, settings, instruments); business logic in
  `backend/services/`; technical analysis in `backend/analysis/`; persistence in
  `backend/database/` (MongoDB singleton `mongodb.py` + Redis singleton `redis_client.py`).
- Background compute is **scheduler-driven, not request-driven**:
  `backend/services/scheduler.py` (APScheduler: 5s LTP heartbeat, 60s candle sync+aggregate,
  reconcile, daily jobs) and `direction_scheduler.py` (1s direction loop).
- Frontend: React 18 + Zustand + Vite + Tailwind in `frontend/src/` — **HTTP polling only,
  no websockets**.
- Market is **IST (Asia/Kolkata), 09:15–15:30**. `EXECUTION_MODE` is `PAPER` | `LIVE`;
  **LIVE places real-money orders.**

**Non-negotiable project conventions**
- All market time is **IST**. Never use naive `datetime.now()` / `datetime.utcnow()` for
  market logic — use helpers in `backend/utils/time_utils.py`.
- Signal/indicator math must run on **closed candles only** — drop the still-forming last bar.
- Engine `confidence` is a **0–1 fraction**, but strategies store `min_confidence` as a
  **percent** — always normalize (`if v > 1: v /= 100`).
- **Secrets**: `backend/.env` and `backend/groww/env` already leaked real live credentials —
  treat them as compromised; never print, commit, or echo secret values.

**Authoritative references at repo root** (read before deep work):
`ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md`, `ISSUES.md` (310 findings, file:line + fixes),
`IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md` (14 ranked improvements).


**Your focus here**
- Frontend in `frontend/src/`: Zustand stores in `store/`, API in `api/` (Axios + interceptor
  in `axios.ts`), pages in `pages/` (Dashboard, Signals, Trades, Strategy, Charts).
- Confirmed real-time/UX defects: a single shared `decision` field in `strategy.store.ts:73-91`
  races across symbols (Dashboard can show the wrong symbol's signal) → **key decisions by
  symbol**; no `AbortController` on rapid symbol switch in `Charts.tsx`; no JWT refresh
  (`axios.ts:31-38`) ejects users mid-trade; `.toFixed` on null SL/target crashes
  `Trades.tsx:407-408`; R/R divide-by-zero in `Signals.tsx:297`; SELL P&L sign wrong in
  `Dashboard.tsx`; indices/decision not polled on Dashboard (stale reference price).
- All data arrives via polling — design for staleness (show data age) and out-of-order responses.
